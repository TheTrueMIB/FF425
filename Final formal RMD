# Abstract

This project explores the factors influencing students’ exam performance using a behavioral and demographic dataset of 1000 observations. We begin with exploratory analysis and initial linear regression, then address multicollinearity among time-use variables (study hours, sleep, etc.) through Principal Component Analysis. Building on this, we construct ANCOVA-style models that incorporate lifestyle, health, and background variables, and explore interaction effects and nonlinear terms. After evaluating assumptions through residual diagnostics, VIF, the Breusch-Pagan test, and Cook’s Distance, we assess model improvements via stepwise selection, Box-Cox transformation, and regularization methods. While LASSO offered minimal benefit, Ridge regression improved generalization performance, achieving a cross-validated R² of 0.62. The final model highlights key predictors such as study effort, mental health, exercise frequency, and a significant interaction between part-time job status and study behavior. This comprehensive modeling pipeline balances interpretability and predictive power while satisfying core regression assumptions.
